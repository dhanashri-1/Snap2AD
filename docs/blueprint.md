## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid Purple (#9F5DE2) for a modern, creative and eye-catching feel, appealing to the diverse range of potential users.
- Background color: Light Lavender (#F4F0F9) to provide a soft, clean backdrop that makes the primary color pop.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#5DADE2) to highlight call-to-action buttons and key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a balance of modern clarity and readability.
- Use a set of modern and minimalist icons in a consistent style. These should visually represent various functionalities, such as upload, share, and download. The icon color should use the accent color.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy, ensuring that key elements are easily accessible. Use white space to prevent clutter, maintain user focus and highlight images.
